    "### A1: According to my experience with my previous NLP project of classifying job descriptions, the first and most important step in this project is labeling the data, i.e. finding the phishing email from the data. But the amount of email is huge because it contains emails from 100 companies with 12 months span. If we have report from customers about phishing mails list, then this is much easier.  But if not, I would start from filtering out all emails related to money transfer. This could be done using simple keywords match with a keywords list of ['money', 'transfer', 'checking', 'account', 'bank', ...]. After filtering out these emails, I will group the emails by sender names, and focus on the senders with multiple emails addresses. This should narrow the email list to a much smaller set that human can check one by one and find all phishing emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Regarding how to identify phishing email in realtime, 1) we can send a warning to the receiver of potential risk if a sender start using a new email. 2) We can compile a sample of labeled normal communication and  money transfer emails and phishing emails found above, and use all the information of the email as features ( the header, content of the email , sender IP, sender email, etc) to train a classification model. Start from logistic regression model and increase the complexity of the model if needed. Precision is the metric we want to maximize because the ground truth can not be reliably determined thus recall is less meaningful. Then we can send warning to receivers if the probabilites of the incoming email is classified as fraud is greater than a specific threshold. 3) We can calculate the similarities of content of incoming email with previous emails from the same sender, and trigger a warning if the similarity is lower than a specific threshold. This reflects a change of writing style that should be recognized. \n",
    "\n",
    "### With the above screening, the majority of phishing email should be identified. "

I've always considered them irritating, stupid and boring. However, after watching this terrible rendition, I was forced to admit that the original Emma was delightful and charming. Ewan McGregor scarcely serves a purpose in this film after they hacked and mutilated the part of Frank Churchill. Gweneth Paltrow is ridiculous in an already ridiculous character and the rest of the film is unremarkable and stupid.<br /><br />My recommendation to anybody who is remotely interested in English period drama... go see the originals.

Claim it as the best/worst film ever made. They consider it to be the best bad movie of all time, even greater then the cult favorite Plan 9 from outer space.The basic plot of the film is that this family goes to another town for a vacation called Nilbog. The town is completely made up of religious vegetarians who love milk for some reason. It turns out that the entire town is made up of goblins hence the name Nilbog which is actually Goblin spelled backwards.The plot itself is just so bad. The actors and actresses are bland and are overacting at many parts of the film. The whole idea of how to beat the Goblins is just goofy in itself. The film itself has NOTHING to do with the previous film, so if you have seen the first film, and expect to see the 2nd film deal with more Trolls you would be disappointed.The film is bad, but there are worse films out there.

In the surprisingly large catalog of this genre, Star Wars Revelations is among the best. One has to cite what most others already have: good costumes, good CG, good sets, a decent core plot idea (unless you are a canonical Star Wars fan) and a very good score by Chris Bouchard. Bouchard uses a few of the standard Star Wars pieces as jumping off points to some fine musical work of his own that nicely weaves known themes throughout in addition to adding excellent new character leitmotifs. One of the things overlooked in some of the other comments is that the director did quite a decent job staging shots, especially in staging the crowd scenes, which is unusual in the Fan Film World, though the fight scenes near the end are weak and the pacing was slow. I do have to agree that the acting is the weak point, but I think one has to be at least a bit forgiving of that, due to this being a production done gratis by a group of Star Wars fans, likely acting in front of a green screen for the first time in their lives. Take a look at Gwyneth Paltrow attempting to act in front of an effects screen in \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" to see how difficult or impossible that can be, even for seasoned performers. Far from being a good movie, one should still consider this a good fan film and applaud all involved for their effort. I would also encourage people to view some of the other fan films out there. As has been noted already, there are some very good ones available (look for \"Grayson\" as one example).'], [array([[0.27587644]]), \"This film undeservedly took a bashing when it was released and since then Get Carter '71 fans have insistently tried to bury it. However, in the 7 years since it's release I've come to realize that this isn't the worst film ever made. It's not even the worst remake ever made.This film felt more like a stylized version of the gritty Michael Caine version which has earned its classic status in British cinema. The one thing I liked about this version versus the original was the fact that they humanized the characters. I could relate more to Carter even if that wasn't the point of the original story. The original film gives us a Jack Carter who will attack or kill anyone he suspects was part of the murder of his brother thus turning it into a hate filled, vengeance fest. There's no character development in Michael Caine's version which explains the campy, cult status it has earned as being a low budget gangster film full of ruthless characters. It was hard to care about any of the characters in the original and films usually lose points with me when I cannot fully connect with a character. If they don't care why should I as a viewer? Regardless of we were supposed to like a character or not in the original I feel that's an essential ingredient for a good film.With that being said the film still suffers it's drawbacks. Mainly the stylized vision of this version will turn off fans of the original from the start. Also, the main villain wasn't convincing enough and I'm talking about Alan Cumming's character. The ending was too hunky-dory but Mickey Rourke was exceptional in the short amounts of time he was on screen.This film is entertaining while not standing up to the 1971 classic, it does stand up as a good Stallone film and a worthy edition to an action fans DVD collection.\"], [array([[0.27512373]]), 'I, quite unfortunately, viewed this film in a film class I am currently enrolled in at Hunter College. As a preface to this film, as well as other Michael Haneke films, my professor declared Haneke as one of her favorite filmmakers, and discussed several film-making techniques (such as the use of the long take, as well as other realistic elements that were supposed to serve the story better) that Haneke offered in his films. I, being a fan of such techniques (and having used some of them in my own films), was slightly excited. However, I then saw this film.This movie was horrendous. The beginning of the film, taking place in a car wash, was interesting. It grabbed my attention. Instantly, my mind started reeling: what was this? Was this related to what I was about to see? Was this the culmination of the rest of the story? Was I seeing the ending first? And, possibly most importantly, was I seeing a symbolic reference to what this movie stood for?At the end of the film, I felt something deep inside me. However, instead of it being that truly remarkable and unmistakable feeling of seeing something that genuinely affected you as a person, filmmaker, artist or moviegoer, it was the kind of feeling that triggered the violent, savage part of me that desired to do little else than find Michael Haneke and tear his insides out with a pitchfork. This film lacked, in all sense of the word, coherency, from the first scene to the last.I understand the concept of \"realism,\" as well as the widely influential style of film-making inspired and, in some ways, birthed by the French new wave. However, this film was attempting to do something that it failed in every respect in doing: it did not seem realistic, the acting was overdone and completely implausible, it offered little to no explanation as to half of the film\\'s plot (a.k.a. why was the girl so distraught, and why was the husband so mentally disassociated?), the directing was far from impressive, the story was boring (and I rarely use the word \"boring,\" but it frankly was), the last thirty minutes or so were beyond ridiculous (with little explanation offered), and the final shot of the film was, to admittedly sound sophomoric (I guess mimicking the film), horrendous.Skip this film, or burn the negative, and go watch a film by Lars von Trier, Gus van Sant, or Inarritu. Good luck.'], [array([[0.27492071]]), \"A surprisingly satisfying film. This film takes the subject matter far more seriously than the original film, with the end result bringing me more into the story then the previous film. While on it's own it's really only passing fair amongst other films of the genre, it's connections to the original film, and it's remaining true to the spirit of the material from which it was drawn made this movie an enjoyable watch for me. Without giving any spoilers, I would have to say as a D&D'er, this film is much truer to the game then the original movie in every possible way. The character's are more interesting, the perils they face are more dire, the antagonists are clever and deceitful (which is rare in any genre), and their is definitely some decent, though not great, acting. I would definitely recommend this movie.\"], [array([[0.27340249]]), 'SPOILER ALERT!!!!! To really discuss the movie adequately, it\\'s practically impossible not to mention that the film is about the afterlife. A small number of people find themselves on a cruise ship and they have no idea where they are headed or why. After a while, it becomes obvious to one passenger that they are all dead but most won\\'t believe him. In the end, they arrive and are judged and sent on to their respective destinations (though conceptually, it\\'s nothing like traditional notions of the afterlife).I am a huge opponent of movie remakes. In the 1930s and 40s, films were often remade--sometimes only a few years after the original film debuted. In practically every case, the remake was really unnecessary and did nothing to improve the original idea, so I am a huge fan of originals. However, to most rules, there are exceptions and OUTWARD BOUND is such a film. This original treatment of the play was a bit stagy but its main problem was the last third of the movie. All the characters who were to be judged weren\\'t nearly as likable or unlikable as they were in the remake (BETWEEN TWO WORLDS) and their final judgment seemed rather anticlimactic and dull. After all that buildup, the conclusion seemed to fall very flat for many. In particular, the selfish society woman was a big disappointment--and her husband wasn\\'t present for this big \"comeuppance\". While not as big a letdown, the nasty business man was also a letdown. About the only characters who weren\\'t that different were Leslie Howard\\'s (along with the lady who chose to go with him) and the couple who attempted suicide.While an interesting idea, the film falters not just because of the lousy payoffs for several characters, but also because the film was so stark and cheesy (though some of this can be attributed to the fact that this was such an early Talkie). In particular, there is no incidental music (not completely unheard of in some 1930 films) and it all seems so flat and staged. Also, the ship models might just be the worst I have ever seen on film since the very early days of cinema--with obvious paintings and toy-like ships that wouldn\\'t fool anyone.So overall, not a particularly good film. A bit dull, a bit stagy, a bit cheap and a bit of a letdown. While I am not a huge fan of the later film, BETWEEN TWO WORLDS, it was a good film and was light-years better than this turgid film.'], [array([[0.27235239]]), 'My friends and I went into this movie expecting something along the lines of a dumb but funny movie like \"Scary Movie\" or \"Not another Teen Movie\".Sad to say, this was the worst movie I\\'ve seen since the beginning of 2005.

It is stupid in an EXTREMELY boring way. The only (barely) entertaining parts of the movie were in the first 10 minutes. The rest of it was filler as the scriptwriter probably ran out of dumb ideas.I, along with probably most of the audience, felt like leaving on the spot.

He\\'s finally accepted into the motley \"Squad F\" crew who find themselves on a dangerous mission to rescue a captured pigeon, voiced by John Cleese.Valiant tries to appeal to both adults and kids but it ends up alienating both of them. The WWII concept is a nice idea but they really didn\\'t do anything interesting with it. The whole idea will go over the kids since they won\\'t be familiar with it so the film relies on cheap gags for laughs. The usual burping, crashing and lame bird jokes are all present here and only a few of them actually work. Adults and teens will probably not be pleased with the humor since it\\'s very obvious and stupid. Luckily, the film is really short and there isn\\'t too much to sit through. The sad part is that the three credited screenwriters couldn\\'t even come up with enough fresh and interesting material to cover 75 minutes worth of film.I think the main reason why the film is so lackluster is because of the weak cast. None of the actors seem to be trying and most of the characters aren\\'t very interesting. Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor when he appears on screen. As a voice actor, he\\'s below average and his voice was all wrong for Valiant. Ricky Gervais gives the only interesting performance as the voice of Bugsy but he can\\'t really save the film.

There is no originality in the script, the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.The main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie, as the biological family consisted of a black father, Indian mother,and white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.I just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.The film does nothing but expand on the trailer, I recommend that if you want to see the film, watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket.\"]]\n"

One has to cite what most others already have: good costumes, good CG, good sets, a decent core plot idea (unless you are a canonical Star Wars fan) and a very good score by Chris Bouchard. Bouchard uses a few of the standard Star Wars pieces as jumping off points to some fine musical work of his own that nicely weaves known themes throughout in addition to adding excellent new character leitmotifs. One of the things overlooked in some of the other comments is that the director did quite a decent job staging shots, especially in staging the crowd scenes, which is unusual in the Fan Film World, though the fight scenes near the end are weak and the pacing was slow. I do have to agree that the acting is the weak point, but I think one has to be at least a bit forgiving of that, due to this being a production done gratis by a group of Star Wars fans, likely acting in front of a green screen for the first time in their lives. Take a look at Gwyneth Paltrow attempting to act in front of an effects screen in \"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\" to see how difficult or impossible that can be, even for seasoned performers. Far from being a good movie, one should still consider this a good fan film and applaud all involved for their effort. I would also encourage people to view some of the other fan films out there.

The whole idea will go over the kids since they won\\'t be familiar with it so the film relies on cheap gags for laughs. The usual burping, crashing and lame bird jokes are all present here and only a few of them actually work. Adults and teens will probably not be pleased with the humor since it\\'s very obvious and stupid. Luckily, the film is really short and there isn\\'t too much to sit through. The sad part is that the three credited screenwriters couldn\\'t even come up with enough fresh and interesting material to cover 75 minutes worth of film.I think the main reason why the film is so lackluster is because of the weak cast. None of the actors seem to be trying and most of the characters aren\\'t very interesting. Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor when he appears on screen. As a voice actor, he\\'s below average and his voice was all wrong for Valiant. Ricky Gervais gives the only interesting performance as the voice of Bugsy but he can\\'t really save the film.

The story was very obvious and predictable. The humor was very lame and stupid. The characters were all flat and uninteresting. The best thing about the movie was the animation and that was only average.

He\\'s finally accepted into the motley \"Squad F\" crew who find themselves on a dangerous mission to rescue a captured pigeon, voiced by John Cleese.Valiant tries to appeal to both adults and kids but it ends up alienating both of them. The WWII concept is a nice idea but they really didn\\'t do anything interesting with it. The whole idea will go over the kids since they won\\'t be familiar with it so the film relies on cheap gags for laughs. The usual burping, crashing and lame bird jokes are all present here and only a few of them actually work. Adults and teens will probably not be pleased with the humor since it\\'s very obvious and stupid. Luckily, the film is really short and there isn\\'t too much to sit through. The sad part is that the three credited screenwriters couldn\\'t even come up with enough fresh and interesting material to cover 75 minutes worth of film.I think the main reason why the film is so lackluster is because of the weak cast. None of the actors seem to be trying and most of the characters aren\\'t very interesting. Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor when he appears on screen. As a voice actor, he\\'s below average and his voice was all wrong for Valiant. Ricky Gervais gives the only interesting performance as the voice of Bugsy but he can\\'t really save the film. John Cleese was only average and he\\'s barely in the film. Besides for the last two, there really weren\\'t any other notable characters or performances.Maybe I\\'m being a little too harsh on the movie but the effort here was very weak. The story was very obvious and predictable. The humor was very lame and stupid. The characters were all flat and uninteresting. The best thing about the movie was the animation and that was only average. Compared to recent films like Robots and The Incredibles, the animation just didn\\'t look very good and it hardly saves the film. In the end, Valiant is mostly a harmless film but it\\'s also a dull one and it isn\\'t worth watching. Rating 4/10'] \n",

This movie is merely a re-shoot of all the films it parodies with different actors. There is no originality in the script, the writers seemed to just bundle a whole heap of scripts of the movies they were parodying together and added childish slapstick bits here and there along with repetitive MTV references that never varied. This made the film boring.The main parody of the film is The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe. Those who have seen the film want to see a clever parody not to see every scene in the film re-enacted by terrible actors. If the movie had been any longer than 90 minutes I swear I could have shot myself.The film also recycles old jokes used in other terrible Friedman and Seltzerparodies. For example, Peter, Edward, Susan and Lucy are meant to be siblings and have the same parents yet are portrayed as a mix of black and white actors. This joke was used in the abysmal Date Movie, as the biological family consisted of a black father, Indian mother,and white and Chinese daughters. This joke was not funny in either of the films.Not Only does the film recycle old jokes from previous parodies but also recycles jokes within the movie, Jayma Mays kicking the beaver wasn't funny the first time, so why do it again.I just hope Friedman and Seltzer run out of genres to make films about.The film does nothing but expand on the trailer, I recommend that if you want to see the film, watch the trailer and save the money you would've spent on the movie ticket.\"] \n",

Not to say that those films are bad, but the things that we see from oversees in this area are getting to be quite impressive. One studio in particular, the Japanese Disney, if you will, Studio Ghibli. Best known as the creative force behind Spirited Away and other Miyazaki films, we forget to see some of the other films that have come from the minds that reside there in. I am talking of Isao Takahata, always by Miyazaki\\'s side, but never really given the credit he deserves. Without this man, there wouldn\\'t be a Studio Ghibli. He is a key character in the development of any and all films to come from the studio, and most likely created the best feature to come forth.\"Grave of the Fireflies\" is, quite possibly, the best animated feature of our time. When a film is done without a camera, when acting is without seeing your actors, and when cinematography is but a pencil line, you have to think about how to rate such a movie. Well, this is the standard on which all animation should be based. The movie is subtle in everything it conveys, but subtle in a way where it can\\'t be ignored. You feel for these characters represented on that screen, and it makes you forget that you aren\\'t watching something \"animated\". The truly beautiful thing about this movie is that as you watch the film, you want to see good things happen to these kids...Yet, as the movie opens, you see the main character, a boy named Seita, die right before your eyes. Immediate and profound. The film opens, and then you have a narration heard over head, that goes like this...\"In 1945, on the night of September 21, I died.\" You hear this almost omniscient voice as the visual shows a boy, tattered and bone thin, propped against a pillar in a train station. Then, as the narrative comes to a close, the boy slouches over, and says in a final breath, \"Setsuko\". Not in anyway is this \"cartoony\" either, his eyes remain open, his mouth agape, and you can just sense that this is the main character of our story. Our \"hero\" is destined to die, and you have to watch the movie show it as it enfolds. A young child will die, and there is no stopping that from coming, no matter how attached you get to that boy. He will die. How harrowing is that? It gets worse when you see the corpse being riddled of its possessions by a security guard. Welcome to the movie. Like many films, though this has a \"G\" rating, you have to see where I stand on that. Already this movie is too much for a child to handle or grasp, and that rating will be misinterpreted as something of a children\\'s movie. Though, being animated, it already has that covered. It\\'s sad, in my opinion, that such a good film as this will remain lost to so many because of simple thinking like that.The movie has you know that all hope you will gain for these characters is futile, that life is never that easy. To keep you realizing this, they have the spirits, or Rei, of Seita and Setsuko (his younger sister) watching on as the events unfold. They appear at times throughout the film where the emotions are high, to keep you in this mold of reality. That means the whole movie is one big flashback, in a sense, but that really doesn\\'t matter. It\\'s the story of two children, lost in the slew of war. People are harsh, and war is unfair. Yoou can\\'t choose who is effected by war, because everyone is, and these are the things that this movie causes you to realize. Other movies involving war have shown this, but it is from the eyes of a child that this gains it\\'s impact. They never lose their innocence, and that is what makes this story so compelling. They are just kids. I\\'m not going to ruin the events of the story for you all, I wouldn\\'t want to tarnish the way you view this film in the least. I will, however, like to sincerely recommend that you find this film, and that you watch it, with no stereotypes of animation. You haven\\'t seen something like this, trust me. It belongs on the list of great war movies, but also on one of the greatest stories ever told. Compelling through and through, I have bought three versions of the movie. Subtitled is best, as it shows not only the original intent, but the true nature of the films culture. This movie remains one of the focal points in the argument of \"anime\" being much more than animated movies from Japan. They can be like any other film, and at times they can beat out most other films,and this is the example to prove it. A beautiful movie, and one that should be seen by anyone who respects movies.'] \n",

Some of the wit from the original stage version shows through, thank God, but director Harold Prince simply did not know how to transfer his work to film.

If you're interested in seeing Harold Prince's film work, a better choice would be Something For Everyone.Elizabeth Taylor clearly had no idea what she was doing for most of the film, and everyone else was decent enough, but nothing to shout about.

This is a film that is recommendable to my fellow fans of cult-sleaze for a pioneering character. As probably many other Exploitation fans out there, however, I must say that my admiration of this film, and my acknowledgment of its pioneering cult character exceeds the actual fun that I had watching it. It is definitely entertaining to watch, but then again, the long scenes of women dancing seductively etc. may have been sleazy and exciting then, but they are quite dated and overlong for today\\'s standards, especially due to the fact that these sequences are very tame compared to what was to come in the 70s. This is also what is to acknowledge about this film however as it is pioneering in its sleaze and weirdness. There is little talking, or, more precisely, dubbing, as people never look at the camera when they talk, which is quite annoying at times. I know this from a bunch of older films, but this is definitely the only film from the late 60s I\\'ve seen, that still uses this form of dubbing, which really needs getting used to.

I love movies that make you agree with every review, good and bad, that you read. I love movies that are almost impossible to classify.Going I knew that Flags of Our Fathers was not a straight forward war film. It is not just the battle of Iwo Jima. Its something more. Its an examination of heroism, propaganda, what people need to believe to win a war, how vets see and speak of the past, how the soldiers see the war and themselves, how parents deal with the death of a child. Its a very complex film. Clint Eastwood has structured it in several layers, like an onion, with flashbacks within flashbacks and within memories. Its never difficult to follow, it just has a great deal going on and it takes a good chunk of the film to begin to understand whats going on and what Eastwood is getting at.To be honest I\\'m not sure what I think of the film. From a technical stand point its one of the best films of the year. Its a masterpiece of the film makers craft. Its beautifully acted as well. Look for Oscar Nominations come the end of the year. Anything the film wins will be well deserved......but I\\'m not sure I \"like\" the film. The problem is that this film is hard to warm up to. It takes a while before you begin to care about anyone, hell before you even really know who anyone is. Then it takes a while to warm up to them. These are not clichéd characters so you can\\'t instantly drop preconceived notions on to, these are people not ideas. Most people are not what you think they are, and some aren\\'t around long enough to know if you were right or wrong.I think anyone who sees the film will have to, in fairness, see it a second time, maybe more. Its a movie that requires you go through it more than once so that you can see it fresh and peel away some of the layers each time you watch it. The first time you see certain things and the next time, now that you know everyone, you\\'ll see more. Its a Chinese puzzle box of a movie. This doesn\\'t make it a bad movie, it just makes it difficult to say if I liked it or not.I think the only ones who are going to dislike it outright are either those who want a straight forward account of the battle or those who refuse to allow the film to be anything than what they thought it should or would be. I thought I had a handle on it going in after reading about it and still I was surprised by what the film really was up to.Yes its graphic, but in someways the emotional truths the film digs at are much more raw than the blood splattering and the limbs flying. The battle begins almost before we know anyone really so that there is this odd distance at the start. Its almost nameless faces and bodies being torn apart. I know I was kind of unaffected to the early scenes of violence, however later once the film shifts to the tour and we revisit the battle and we have a sense of who these men are the effects are devastating. Though the real power of the film lies in its simple scenes of mere humanity which moved me moved me more than any of the acts of violence.I don\\'t know what else to say other than see this movie, just be prepared to do so more than once.'] \n",

I think I was putting it off because I instinctively knew it was going to be awful, and I was right. It is one of the dullest, most atrociously acted films I've ever seen. The acting was stody and boring, and considering the acting talent involved (Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson), you'd think Lucas could have done something spectacular with them. Alas, no. Lucas has said numerous times that he detests directing (this was the first film he's directed in over 20 years since the original Star Wars film), and his contempt for directing shows. It feels like a sonambulistic exercise, intent on putting us to sleep, and it has an overall lackadaisical feel that really irks the viewer. Many who saw this were extremely disappointed because they loved the originals so much (the original 3 are far superior than this tripe). They more than likely felt a sense of obligation and loyalty to see this film and the progressively worse prequels. They grew up with the original Star Wars films, and they went away disappointed and angry at the fact the prequels were inferior in every way to the originals... Lucas's dialogue is wretched, his pacing is totally off, and he seems to be killing time here. There's no real enthusiasm here, in front of the camera or in back of it. Perhaps the actors picked up on the fact that Lucas didn't give a damn about his own film, so why should they? I sometimes think Lucas purposely made bad prequels so he wouldn't have to film the final 3 chapters. And why did he decide to make the prequels?

I have not seen the Renegade Edition, so my review is based on the earlier version.The Renegade Edition of Highlander 2 is quite different from The Quickening, because the original director went back, and completely re-edited the film, restoring it as closely as possible to the way he had originally intended for it to be, as opposed to The Quickening, which had been heavily meddled with by various people within the studio that produced the film. ***\"] \n",

At a close up of one of the troops pulling back on the bolt to load the rifle you do not see anything going into the breach. And those eyes of the title character. I think the makeup was purchased from the nearest dollar store. This film is only recommended for those individuals who enjoy watching the worst films ever made.\"] \n",

I was somewhat put at ease at the beginning of the film when it became obvious that this film did not take itself seriously (which CANNOT be said for most bad movies). However, this film instead tries to be a spoof (of many things) and fails at every single attempt. As a film, a 5 year old could create a movie with better technical value. The sound, film quality, acting, and dialogue are bottom-of-the-barrel bad. I did not rent this movie thinking that it would be \"Citizen Kane\", but the problems with this film go FAR beyond the lack of ANY technique.

He made rough, hardcore, groundbreaking grindhouse cinema \\x96 regardless if they\\'re good films or not they were unique and opened doors for a great director. Unfortunately throughout the 20th Century Craven went on and off from horror to comedy, to drama to thriller and so on but what I never knew about was his sequel to the original The Hills Have Eyes; reading up on The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 I came across an article stating Craven made the film for some extra cash. Well, I\\'m not surprised.Craven poured his heart, soul and love into the original movie The Hills Have Eyes \\x96hate it or love it, it is evident Craven put effort into it; did he with this sequel? No. Here you can see talented film makers, writers and actors putting in laughably weak efforts with a cruddy script, paper thin characters, an obscure and ill fitting Friday the 13th-esque score/vibe, silly special effects and overwhelming mountains of unintelligence. For an example; every character has a flashback within the first twenty minutes of the film and to make the movie more inept than it already is, even a dog has a flashback! This movie is a flashback extravaganza! The acting is irritating to the extent where it is painfully unbearable. One character is blind though you won\\'t know it until she actually says so as she is so poorly written and unconvincingly acted. There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home \\x96 blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written. Do not expect Michael Berryman to have slurred words, a speech impediment and borderline brain damage as you see here in this film he speaks quite fluently and walks like an average person; was this the Pluto we saw in the original film? Nope. If you\\'re looking for any incestuous, inbred, radioactively mutated hill killer like the first film this is certainly not the place to look for it; especially when the mutants in this film can drive motorcycles (stylishly so). This film has no character development, bad acting and a story copied and pasted from the first and slasher formulated \\x96 this is Friday the 13th mixed with The Hills Have Eyes. For 1985 I guess that is where the money came in.Something that really irritated me (amongst everything else) was this spontaneous introduction of Reaper. Who is he? Where did he come from? Sure, the hillbilly father in the original film could have kept something from Big Bob Carter and not told him of his other mutant offspring but it\\'s just...illogical, especially when Reaper is so unintentionally funny. Also, whatever happened to the other characters from the first film? What happened to Brenda, Doug or the mama mutant or any of the other surviving mutants? Not only the lack of character explanations but these new characters are simply put; murder dolls \\x96 as I said, this is Friday the 13th though the only problem in saying that is that these teenagers don\\'t have sex, smoke drugs, drink alcohol, be naked \\x96 nothing. They\\'re so unbelievably boring and they don\\'t even have the classic slasher teen formula going for them \\x96 what a waste.The film has cheesy special effects (just look at the cover) and the script is the exact same as the first. This movie isn\\'t even entertaining \\x96 it\\'s just painfully awful. You see it is films like The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is why horror is very overlooked and under-rated as a genre. The non-horror viewing public slander horror films as predictable, cheesy and stupid however there are a lot of horror films out there that prove such a statement false \\x96 though The Hills Have Eyes part 2 not only encourages the \"all horror movies are dumb\" idea but takes it ten steps further. This movie has no soul and that\\'s where I question Wes Craven as a director. It has one too many Friday the 13th elements to it and it\\'s so unbelievably bad \\x96 but not in a good way like Troll 2 or Manos: The Hands of Fate.

Some fans were hoping for a edge of your seat, truly terrifying horror movie much like the original Alien. No matter what you want, hope, or expect from this film you will be disappointed.The direction this film takes is a horror route. It tries to be like the original Alien movie in the sense that the horror has to come more from the characters and their fear than from the monsters themselves. Paul Anderson tries to show as little Alien & Predator as possible without being ridiculous and let the actors & characters sell us the fear. Now this sounds like a good approach to a film and normally it would be. Here however it is the reason the films fall flat on its face. The problem being is that the characters aren\\'t interesting and their actually paper thin cut outs. And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.But as I said, Paul Anderson tries to hide the monsters and show as little as possible much like the formula Ridley Scott & James Cameron used for their films. And thats where the film fails. Fans come to see this movie to see Aliens & Predators fighting. They don\\'t come to see Sanna Lathan and the other people run around a dark pyramid. Fans didn\\'t wait 14 years to see paper thin characters run around all over the place. They go to see Aliens & Predators.The film should have taken the action route and gives us large amounts of AVP battles. However Paul Anderson only gives us ONE, count them One, true fight scene between an ALien & predator. And that fight scene doesn\\'t occur until half-way through the film and it only lasts 2 minutes. 2 minutes. As a fan I did not wait this long to see a AVP movie only to have one battle that lasts 2 minutes.Above I said \"true battle\" because there is technically another battle. It is between a Predator, Lex, and an Alien Queen. Much like the first AVP battle it is disappointingly short and 90% of the battle focuses on lex fighting the queen than it does focus on the Predator. After a while you begin to think the title \"Alien vs. Predator\" is inappropriate and instead should be called \"The Adventures of Lex\". Paul Andersons direction leaves out the two title characters.The idea of hiding your monsters appearance till half way through the film and rely more on your characters is a formula that has worked in the past. It even potentially could have worked here but in order for that to happen you need to do one thing. Make the characters more interesting. If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren\\'t going to care about them and then they quickly become bored. The film should have done is focus less on characters and more on the monsters. It amazes me so much on how the film lacks on what the title promises.'] \n",

I was surprised to see this on their schedule, as it's usually the lowest rate affair. The situation was another example of a great work getting lost in another vast video copy collection.I was excited to be seeing an early movie from a director I always admired. I'd only ever seen his Hollywood work, and was especially fond of his Sci-Fi classics growing up. As others recognize, Verhoeven unashamedly puts into his films, his honest impression of the societal constructs we humans consistently find ourselves in. That regular criticism of the complexities of human nature, beyond the norms of each film's particular genre, has always resonated with my world view.I finally watched this film this morning. As it started it was obvious the image quality was very poor, not helped by early scenes being predominantly in the dark. Not surprisingly the character's voices were dubbed into English, but were often mismatched or exaggerated, unfitting for the film. It seems to be the UK version I saw, yet some accents were American. I always try to watch a film in it's original intended language, but it seems the foreign films on the local community station are only ever poorly dubbed video copies.Despite the poor quality of the copy I saw (the video company's logo even popped up irregularly in the bottom corner of the image), this film really amazed me. Much of the reasons why have been detailed by the few other comments on this site. The biggest flaw of the story for me was that the film ended too suddenly. This seems a common element to films the further back in cinema history you go. I actually appreciate a well crafted credits sequence, easing the viewer out of the film's world, and allowing reflection. Even at nearly 2 hours long, I felt my interest would have been sustained for a little bit longer.There is a DVD listed here with 5 of Verhoeven's films in their original Dutch form, with English subtitles. I'd like to see this one again, and the rest of his early creations, which others consider even better. Rutger Hauer is also a great, varied yet charismatic actor, and it seems his best work might be with Verhoeven.\"] \n",

There was no \"rah-rah\" attitude anywhere in this film. This is one of the first films that put women in the spotlight as true war heroes, and in the front lines. The movie was extremely important for women, and how women are viewed in films. This film centers around the true horrors that the courageous nurses who served in WWII at Corregidor went through. NOTHING at all was candy coated, so to speak. As you watch this film, and remember that it was made in 1943, you will be shocked at some of the content for that time period. Amazing performances by all, including the great Claudette Colbert, George Reeves (from Superman fame), Veronica Lake (In certainly her finest performance), and Paullette Goddard who was nominated for an Academy Award. The script for this film was written by using the stories from journals, and diaries of the actual nurses who served at Corregidor. Some of these nurses made it back, and some didn\\'t. Some of the surviving nurses of Corregidor were also brought in during production as technical advisors to the film makers. A few of them were even used as extras. Issues of Life magazine, and photographers from Life magazine who were there, were brought in assure even more accuracy concerning uniforms, and surroundings. The fact that this movie was released while the war was still going on, is further testament to it\\'s courageous stance in not candy coating the horrors of war. This is one of the few old WWII films that I would love to see remade. A remake of this film could be as huge as \"Saving Private Ryan\" As you watch the film, you will see what I mean. This film was well written, had outstanding acting, mature subject matter for the time period, and was an historical achievement for putting courageous women in the spotlight.

Though I do like the \"Unhappy Campers\" and \"Teenage Wasteland,\" they are tad to thick on the humor than I would have preferred. So, I waited and waited and waited patiently for this film to finally be released. Well, it was, and while I appreciate the nostalgic feel to the film, and the fact that is a slasher film through and through and knows its origins, the film, for me, was a huge let down for ONE reason alone: the character that we are suppose to sympathize with the most and who is by all accounts the main character of the film (Alan) has to be one of the most annoying characters in film history. He is rude, disgusting, nasty to everyone, and not likable in the least. When campers pick on him, we root them on and I really wanted him to be the first to die.What made the first film effective was that Angela, who got picked on the very same ways Alan does in this film, doesn\\'t deserve it. She is quiet, sweet, and introverted. She doesn\\'t cause any problems for anyone, so when the people who harass her the most begin to meet their deaths, the audience can silently cheer. Having a unlikable main character can ruin any film, and this is a prime example.If you can get past the annoying Alan, \"Return to Sleepaway Camp\" follows virtually the same plot as the original, but with less originality and more clichés. Ronnie, the counselor from the original, now owns his own camp. Typical teenage behavior is shown, and when the campers begin picking on Alan (who again, DESERVES IT!), they begin to meet grisly deaths. Ronnie quickly blames Angela, even going as far as to accusing another counselor who is OBVIOUSLY much to young to be her, of being Angela. Unfortunately, due to a pretty lame disguise, the killer\\'s identity is not hard to figure out. The \"Angela\" aspect of the film is also played down quite a bit, so much so that this really could have been any typical camp slasher unrelated to the \"Sleepaway Camp\" series. Yes, Angela is mentioned, but she is hardly a crucial component to the plot, and even the ending is abrupt and explains very little and certainly isn\\'t the return to glory that one of the most interesting slasher film killers in history deserved.There are some creative kills, but I honestly thing the original sequels are better and more brutal in this department.

No. I first saw the movie at the cinema upon its release and, at that time, I did think that it was one of the worst films I\\'d seen up to that point. I\\'ve watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate. Apart from a pervading incoherence, I think the film\\'s major problem is its slightness; it\\'s only an hour and a half long and the plot is very simplistic to say the least. It\\'s not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster. Another big problem is the casting of Uma Thurman as Emma Peel. Thurman has shown herself to be a fine actress in movies such as Pulp Fiction but she just looks out of her depth here (I never believed in her as a top-level scientist for a second) and her English accent doesn\\'t sound natural. Nicole Kidman, to whom the role was first offered, would surely have been better, in particular, she\\'s displayed flawless English accents in films such as The Others and The Hours. An English actress I also think would have made a great Peel is Joely Richardson but the studio would probably have vetoed such a choice on the grounds of her not being a big enough name. Ralph Fiennes was a real enigma in this film - there was nothing wrong in principle in casting him as Steed but he looks ill at ease throughout the movie as if he\\'s rather be elsewhere. I can only assume he\\'d already twigged that the film was going to be a turkey. What\\'s worse, Fiennes and Thurman have absolutely no chemistry between them, which wastes the snappy dialogue they have with each other throughout the film. The supporting cast fare a bit better with seasoned pros such as Sean Connery, Jim Broadbent and Fiona Shaw making the most of their underdeveloped parts. The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there\\'s no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what\\'s good about the film is easily drowned out by what\\'s bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads. Handled properly, the film could have been a wonderful success for all concerned, the first chapter of an entertaining and lucrative franchise, stretching well beyond the 1990s; instead it\\'s one of the most embarrassing flops of that decade. The original cut of the film was apparently two and a half hours long but, following negative reactions from audiences at test screenings, the studio hacked the film down to its present one and a half hour length. This doesn\\'t actually come as much of a surprise as there is a lack of proper narrative flow to the film suggestive of chunks of explanatory scenes having been cut out. Just one example: towards the end of the film, just before they enter Sir August\\'s underwater lair, Steed and Peel enter a phone box and Peel says \"how now brown cow?\" down the phone. The phrase seems to be a password to enter the premises but how does Peel know it? There\\'s been talk here and there of the possibility of Warners releasing a director\\'s cut or special edition DVD, restoring the original two and a half hour version. I think this would be a good idea and I\\'d definitely be interested in watching the full version of the film. It\\'s highly unlikely to be any kind of masterpiece but it\\'s difficult to imagine that it wouldn\\'t improve upon the movie as it stands. At the very least you\\'d have to assume that it would be more coherent. Sadly I don\\'t think the chances of Warners going down this line are high; I have the feeling that this is a movie the studio would rather forget about than draw attention to.'] \n",

The jokes seemed forced, the plot was unoriginal, as stated prior, and the movie overall had no purpose in being released to the theaters.

First off, don't come in expecting a stylish, extravagant film with excellent cinematography. Neil Labute's direction is the epitome of minimalism, with virtually no camera movement and entire scenes played out in one shot. I'm not totally sure, but I'd say there are maybe two or three medium close-ups in the entire film, and that's it. The characters are always viewed from a distance, reflecting Labute's background in theater (if you like this, by the way, read Bash, it will blow your mind) and allowing his actors to be as realistic and naturalistic as possible. Contrary to popular belief, stage acting is more natural than film acting; Labute's distance and long takes create a realism that is rarely seen on celluloid.This film is pretty much all dialogue, but this is some of the best-written dialogue I have ever heard. I don't think any man can watch this movie without recognizing some of the conversations that take place in this film. Aaron Eckhart and Matt Molloy are pitch perfect as the chauvinist, attractive, and ultimately evil Chad and the nerdy, pathetic, and ultimately emotionally doomed Howard. Stacy Edwards as the deaf Christine is also very strong; in fact, when I saw her in another movie speaking normally I almost fell out of my chair. I won't say much about the plot, for this is one of those movies that's really better to go in knowing nothing and watch the sickening events unfold. Let me just say that this film has a twist ending that marks one of the few moments in film that truly shocked me. In fact, I challenge anyone to sit still through this scene; I've seen the movie five times and it still makes me squirm in my seat. If you're looking for a big shock, look no further than this masterpiece, but don't expect a cheap thrill. Next to Vertigo, I don't think any film has hit me with a greater psychological impact.

Why is this so hard to believe? Well, you'd expect that this film would be really, really good since it was such an important film--and you'd be 100% wrong. This mish-mash film was just as bad as many of the later films and is only marginally watchable. Not surprisingly, it has passed into the public domain--after all, who would want to renew rights to this film?! Some of the film's problems may or may not exist in the original Italian print. I don't know, as I have only just watched one of the English dubbed versions. The biggest and most obvious problem are the voice actors--their voices are too mechanical and bigger than life--so much so that they seem nothing like real people at times. The original Italian voices might be a lot better. Another problem (mostly for history freaks like myself) is that the films are a bizarre melange of both Greek AND Roman mythology--with Roman and Greek names interspersed throughout the film and the stories often bear little semblance to the originals. This is very sloppy but could also be the fault of the dubbers--perhaps the original film was based only on Greek or Roman characters--not both. Maybe in the original Italian it all made more sense.However, despite the sloppy dubbing, another major problem is that the film has too much in the way of plot. There are enough stories for two films. Why they chose to combine the story of Jason and the Argonauts seeking the golden fleece (a Greek tale) AND Hercules (Roman) dealing with an annoying king and his really annoying son is beyond me--especially because both characters could easily have several films of just their own adventures. In fact, with the story of Jason, huge portions of the tale are missing (such as the most important part--his relationship with Medea and her father) and the Hercules one simply doesn't look anything like the classical tales--nothing.The film has a few fun moments, but overall it looks cheap and sloppy--like most Hercules films. Some of the characters make no sense at all (such as the princess who loves Hercules but fights with him when Herc sets out to do EXACTLY what she'd asked him to do) and some are so one-dimensional they looked like they were written by a 3rd grader. If you LIKE cheap and sloppy films (I know I sure do), then this is definitely for you. If not, then see the Disney version.

So why is that? It's because films are aimed at lower/middle class traditionalist uneducated people who cling onto whats familiar. Offcourse we are all like that in a way. Slowly but surely Bollywood directors are realising that there is an even bigger market outside India. I must admit that at times Ive been frustrated by Bollywood film making antics. There is so much unique and beautiful material on which many great films can be made. Indeed there have been attempts with films such as Dil Se, however I have not been impressed with the execution of a potentially good film idea. Theres is too much of a temptation for these directors to turn the film into a media circus, cheesy songs are one medium for this. Why am I reviewing the state of Bollywood industry instead of the film, one might ask? Well after watching this movie and loving it, my intial thought was : was this film great because it was different and a break from the cheesy nonsense that bollywood has thrown my way before. Or was this film great because it was actually a great film. After scanning the film memory fresh in mind I decided it was the latter. Never have I seen such articulate cinematography. So much attention being paid to not only the materialistic side of the film but also the character depth. The three characters in the movie are great. As with all good films, the plot is simple. What makes a really good film i've always believed is the strength of the characters on film, How well they come across the screen and how believable they are. This film achieves all these factors and more. The film is about the changing lives of three college freinds, their relationships and how these relationships develope as they get older. The film doesn't actually deal with that many issues, two in the main, Love and adventure. How original is that you might say, well I'd say it is very original since the approach taken to handle these issues is very unique. Aamir Khan as always has done really well, and taken to the new style of character with ease, the two supporting actors Akshay Khanna and Saif Ali Khan are brilliant. The casting director has done well to cast these two in their particular roles, as it suits them perfectly; Akshay as a serious thoughtful character and Saif as bubbly and funny airhead (reminded me of Matt Le Blanc's Joey character in the US comedy sitcom Freinds) This film I have to say has very few flaws, and I'd like to think I can spot them, infact I canot remember even one at this particular moment in time.

As you can tell, I wasn\\'t a fan of this film and was momentarily turned away from cheap horror movies. \"13 Seconds\" garnered several awards, is recognized in the film community, but for me was just a sloppy film with the irritable inconsistent voice dub. I think that is what harmed this film the most \\x96 but then I gave up on my plight to avoid cheap horror films and decided to watch the equally low-budget horror/suspense/thriller film \"The Attic Expeditions\", and I must admit, I was rejuvenated. This film was a breath of confusing fresh air. From the sporadic, yet strong, opening, through the rest of this nonconsecutive film about magik (with a \"K\"), the philosophy of modern medicine, and perhaps love, I was hooked. From the films that I have watched lately, this was one that I was eager to start from the beginning and watch again. While I cannot say that director Jeremy Kasten has created a flawless film, he has impressed me by giving us a strong story with a limited budget. This was a film obviously loved by everyone involved and in my eyes has the ability to become a cult classic if watched by an open-mind audience.We follow the story of Trevor Blackburn, who may or may not have killed his fiancé while performing a magik ritual. Due to possible insanity, he is operated on and forced to recuperate in a facility simply called \"House of Love\". It is in this \"house\" that Trevor continues to have flashbacks coupled with nightmares, coupled with sudden murders of the other tenants. He is observed, from a distance \\x96 through television monitors, by a Dr. Eck (played sinisterly by Jeffrey Combs) and his associate, Dr. Coffee (played by Ted Raimi). This give us the impression that perhaps this is not the place we assume, and that it is just a set-up by Eck for a more dutiful purpose. Then, quite classically, as we think we know the truth to this film, director Kasten gives us one last push of the unknown and before the screen our minds are shattered.I think what appealed to me the most was that albeit this was a very low-budget film, the creators did everything possible to make this less cheap and more detail oriented. I loved the visual style of this film. The way that our characters acted, the way the interacted with each other, and their deadpan ability to bring the unknown to the surface. It was as if I was watching \"Evil Dead\" for the first time (not that I want to draw similarities \\x96 it was just a similar viewing experience). There were elements of Gilliam, mixed with Raimi, mixed with Nolan all rolled together. Although the international name for this film is \"Memento 2\", please do not connect the two. This film stands on its own. Kasten assembled a flawless cast with a surprising turn from Seth Green (playing a very Patrick Bateman character) and the always fun Jeffrey Combs. I even enjoyed the Kyle MacLachlan-esquire style of Andras Jones \\x96 then there was Ted Raimi, whom didn\\'t almost fit within this film, but still made it fun to see him sweat. Alas, those eager to see Alice Cooper, he was only in it for a brief moment, though the special features claim he was a valuable asset to the production. I didn\\'t see it. With this seemingly strong cast in place, it was up to the storyteller to get the rest in motion \\x96 and it happens successfully.\"The Attic Expeditions\" is not a one-time-viewing film. I think what makes me rave so much about this film is the way the story was told, out of context, out of consecutive order, out of sanity. You cannot make an assumption about this film from just one viewing, one must go back \\x96 rewatch, and enjoy. I will say this much, it is not a film for everyone. The scenes can be unsettling and a bit disturbing since you do not quite fully know if he is in his mind or in ours. Rather disturbing actually. Kasten plays not only with the character\\'s minds, but also with ours. \"The Attic Expeditions\" is one of those films that leaves the room either going, \"gosh that was horrible\", or wide open for discussion. For me, I needed someone to talk to. I wasn\\'t sure what was real, and what was in Trevor\\'s mind. That is what makes this film stand out. While there were some shots of a boom in some scenes, but again, that is what makes this low-budget film even better. Concentrate on what you cannot comprehend, and this will be a phenomenal film for you.Overall, I gotta say that after a slew of mediocre Hollywood budget films, this was a volatile breath of fresh air. I challenge anyone that dislikes this film to ask \"why\" -- is it because you didn\\'t understand the story or because it was cheaper than the mass produced films. With a film like \"The Attic Expeditions\", more chances are taken \\x96 the risks are higher, and the final product is worth a second viewing. As others have quoted, and I believe them, this is a horror film for those of us that pride ourselves on intelligence. It is smart, challenging, and grossly entertaining. I don\\'t mind calling this film cheap because it entertained me mentally, and I will go back to rewatch to see if a second viewing would un-muddle the questions looming in my mind.

The film tells the tale of four teenagers who are terrorized and tortured by a bizarre southern family living in a remote farmhouse in 1977. The film uses all sorts of camera tricks--negative colouring, split-screens and seemingly random inserts of grainy snuff-like footage of various S&M and gore images; the off-the-wall effect is similar to what Oliver Stone did in Natural Born Killers. The film is not about plot, or about characters. Its purpose is to shock and disturb, to serve no other function than to entertain through exploitation and disgusting and bizarre violence. Just as you think the limits of weirdness are approaching, Zombie takes the film a step farther, and before long you surrender yourself to the mercy of the film and just accept things for what they are. The film has the feeling of an out of control freight train being piloted by a madman and the climax of the film is truly bizarre. The reviewers who wrote the film off as overly-sadistic with little in the ways of character development, plot or suspence have come to see a different kind of film, perhaps more at home with titles like The Sixth Sense or Silence of the Lambs.

To see the inevitable Unrated Directors Cut on video is going to be a true horror experience.But this film is something has hasnt been seen in decades and it has been made with the utmost care that only a true horror fan could provide.

The first film I saw from him was the eighth part, Hellworld, and I don't rate it too highly - however, it's certainly the best one he's done. Hellseeker sees the return of Ashley Laurence to the series in the role of Kirsty, and the good news is that she still has the charming good looks that made her role in the first two films so good. The good news stops there, however, as just like the rubbish seventh part; Hellseeker sees Rick Bota in dull mystery territory once again.

He's surrounded by slutty women, and the cops think he killed his wife...maybe he's in hell...What's really annoying about this film is that buried somewhere beneath the messy screenplay, is the grounds for a fairly good plot. When the film finally reveals itself in the final ten minutes, the short sequences that put everything together are miles better than the rest of the film, and it makes me wonder why the writers decided to make the film work from the standard hallucination filled plot when there's was a far darker, much more interesting and, most of all, far more relevant to the series, story waiting in the wings. It's obvious that whoever's in charge of these new Hellraiser films doesn't give a damn about the series and the fans...but what doesn't make sense is that, if a good one was made, word of mouth would get round and more profit would eventually be made.

      "[array([[0.24975985]]), \"I just watched Inland Empire, and could not be more disappointed. I am a fan of David Lynch. He, and Dario argento(his earlier films), I consider to be the best directors. However, this movie really is a departure from what we have come to expect of David Lynch.Let's have a look at a few of his hits: Twin peaks: The TV series, well, even the episodes he directed were all very good. However, the last episode of twin peaks really dragged as it just went between different rooms, becoming quite comical.Mullholand drive: Made for TV originally, then made into a movie. Lynch was forced to stay within boundaries, which seems to work well for him.Inland Empire: David Lynch became far too self-indulgent. After the initial walk into this movie, where we are introduced to Laura Dern's character, where we learn that she is an actress, desperate for a new role in an upcoming movie. We learn there is a curse on the movie, where the last two leads of the movie died. It has an interesting enough build up, until it goes completely off course. The entire last two hours of the movie become nothing more than Laura Dern walking through hallways, even more corridors than in Alien 3, but without the excitement of the Alien.The score/music is really off as well. I would say that in the past, David Lynch's directing and visual style has come first, followed always by a solid score, and memorable songs. However, in this movie, the first thing I noticed was that we would be introduced to a pretty bland scene where not much happens, only to be shaken by the overly loud and intrusive score. For example, a light flickers... not that exciting, right? Well, it's not, but the music is so loud and alarming that it convinces us that the scene is intense. Several similar scenes that aren't very scary visually, are meant to be scary due simply to the music informing us to feel this emotion. I know this from the girl sitting in front of me, who wasn't scared by the initial images of things, but by the blaring music that would follow informing her to be terrified. And the songs that play... one example in particular is a key scene that takes place on a street. A Beck song begins to play. Okay, for one this is a David Lynch movie known for setting mood. Based on the gritty style of directing, and the Beck song playing, it takes anything serious from the scene and quickly made me think it was a trailer for the latest movie starring Eminem, on da' streets yo! As for Acting, I really believe Laura Dern did all she could do. She was given a very vague role...well, I should say roles. She plays an actress, a hooker, a house wife. However, unlike all of Lynch's previous films, this movie lacks any romance, and a strong female that you care about. Just as you are in the position of starting to care about her character, we are quickly taken to a dream world where no more is known about her. If anything, after we go to the little dream world that takes over the entire last 2 hours of the film, anything we have learned or liked about her are quickly killed as the film tends to focus on her as an abused, sadistic, and bitter woman.As for the visual style, I would say it is non-existent. There are no beautiful shots, and this is not even due to the digital video. I believe that David Lynch was so caught up in himself, that he thought he wouldn't need the beautiful film making that made him famous. Rather than great shots and angles, we are delivered very straight forward scenes, usually in a hallway of some form. And on top of that, the later portion of the movie tends to have scenes right out of a mafia movie of older men sitting around tables talking about things that would otherwise be boring in a movie without the occasional offing of someone, like in any typical mobster movie. However, we don't get that in this movie, so all of these scenes have no payoff.The worst part of the movie is the length. I am one who believes that in general the average length of a movie should be 90 minutes at most. There are some great epics that can be 3 hours long, on the rare occasion. However, majority of movies start losing steam fairly early on, like Inland Empire. Considering it seems to be nothing more than about twenty of minutes of real movie, followed by a bunch of stock footage filmed by David Lynch. It makes me think of the movie Ed Wood, where he is looking over stock footage of I believe an explosion and buffalo running and thinking of ways to put that into a movie. That is what I got of this movie. Let's film a bunch of footage, then put it together so it seems very dream-like, and use Lynch's name to sell it as a very artsy work of art. At least make it original, I mean, this felt like a dozen of other straight to video movies I've seen that upcoming filmmakers have made.I for one, am a fan of David Lynch, as I have been of Dario Argento's part work. However, I will not continue to be a fan of Lynch's work if it will be nothing more than him filming anything that comes to mind in Digital Video and throwing it together. He made his fans by giving us beautifully made, well filmed movies. If you are going to use DV, then at least make it interesting. If not, then go back to film, please, and give us a boring but beautiful movie.\"] \n",

Then there's one saying that they weren't warned like they are with a John Waters film...um, did you see the warning at the beginning of the film? Or listen to Uwe Boll in the opening? It makes me think some of these reviews are fake. One of the best zombie movies? Nooo, not even the positive ones seem like they've seen it.

After the warnings on how bad it is from Uwe Boll and retard doctors (I'm serious) you get Brinke Stevens humping Tom Savini. You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini. Then Savini is gone. Perhaps my biggest beef with the film is the in and out cameos. The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film. I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex, Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours.

If the makers of this film have been around for a while you should probably stop. What sold me on the movie is just the weirdness of it. I really don't have any other way to put it. The actors are crap, the movie looks like good digital, there's nothing special about the way it's filmed or edited, the make up is probably good for no budget but not for something with a budget so all this movie ends up having going for it is it's weirdness.

The film does have strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some violence so this is no movie for parents to see with their kids at least not until their seventeen or over. Overall Original Sin isn't that good of a movie and you're better off watching something else. Unless your a kid who wants to see Jolie featured in a graphic sex scene and without her clothes on then this is the movie for you. Otherwise skip Original Sin and watch a better thriller that's worth watching more than once.\"] \n",

Still, I'm a movie lover, and i can find something good about any movie. This film has it's moments. There is a unique fight sequence that takes place in a balloon room that is worth seeing.

Well let me be the first to tell you --- This is a complete SHAM.The movie starts off very slow and bored me to sleep in the first 30 minutes. Because I am a huge fan of B-rate horror movies, I managed to down (3) of my favorite energy drinks in hopes of pulling through to the end.

Then, he proceeds to destroy a bunch of buildings that look even cheaper and sillier than those found in the Japanese giant monster films from Toho Studios! Most of the time, he moves about in super-slow motion and does a whole lot of nothing. And, as he does not much at all, you hear circus-like music. This time, however, the movie is a bit different, as the extras are all Korean AND their command of English is amazingly bad--so bad that it's rather funny to hear some of them stumble over even the simplest words.Sadly, however, as the movie progresses, you learn that the cheap sets and guy in the gorilla suit and Koreans who can't speak English are the BEST aspects of the film!! That's because the acting is abysmal, the editing was done by a chimp, many scenes featuring screaming Korean peasants went on too long, the music highly inappropriate as well as annoying and the dialog is among the worst I've ever heard. Believe me, Ed Wood couldn't have made a gorilla film any worse than this (including his own BRIDE AND THE MONSTER).There are unnecessary subplots involving a rather bland-looking actress and her boyfriend as well as a Colonel who is a total idiot (and needs a good haircut to even remotely look military) and curses CONSTANTLY--possibly more than any character in the 1970s. Aside from these stupid subplots, the rest of the film is essentially KING KONG but set in a Korea that is chock-full of crappy sets.Overall, there really is nothing to recommend this film--unless you really need to see a guy in a gorilla suit flipping off the army (I kid you not--this REALLY happened in the movie). It's so bad, that it's a film almost exclusively for bad movie fans. It's also a great film for Jeff Bridges, Jessica Lange or Dino De Laurentiis to watch so that they can see that by comparison, the poor 1976 KING KONG film is like a Merchant-Ivory production!

I normally say that a person should give every movie at least one chance (and watch it all the way through) in order to make a complete assessment of the film. This is the first film that I wouldn\\'t recommend to anybody, save yourself the time and go outside and enjoy a moment with your friends or something. This film is the first film to make me ever say, don\\'t bother. Quite an achievement.The majority of the film is borrowed from It\\'s a Mad Mad World, and when I say borrowed I mean copied without any distinction what so ever. Unfortunately, this film is so awful that I have no inclination to watch It\\'s a Mad Mad World because I know the memories of this film will be conjured up. The opening scenes are copied from Johnny English and Mr. Bean. First we meet Deshbandhu Roy (Retish Deshmuk) who is working as a Government agent (this can only be presumed as it is not explained), it copies the opening scene in which Johnny English tells his superior that the area they are in is safe until a car explodes in the background. The scene itself is not even set out that well and provides no introduction to the character what so ever, that and the fact that it has nothing to do with the rest of the film. The second scene involves a character who\\'s name I cannot remember (and an actor who should go back to waiting tables), so we\\'ll just call him Annoying Fool from now on. His first scene is copied from the episode of Mr. Bean where Bean gets his hand stuck in the back of a stranger\\'s pocket and ends up following them into a bathroom stall. To round up the foursome we have Aditya (Arshad Warsi) and Boman Contractor (Aashish Chowdhry).If you\\'re going to make a light hearted fun family entertainment film, you should have characters that are good and sympathetic that get caught up in hi-jinks and whatnot. After being kicked out of their abode for their failure to pay rent, the foursome come up with the idea of selling to paintings to relatives of the recently deceased, in short, conning people who are grieving. Not the best of ideas for both the characters or the writers. They are arrested for a crime they did not commit (in a scene so shockingly bad the writer should go back to cleaning toilets) and are promptly released in the middle of no where, where a car crashes and out rolls a dying man who informs them that a fortune of INR10 Billion waits for them because they \\'are good people\\'. The journey begins and the copy of IMMW begins. Sanjay Dutt plays a police officer who gets caught up in the proceedings and also involved are a bandit (who does nothing for the script) and Contractor\\'s father (who also doesn\\'t do a damn thing for the film).The bad: The writing is horrible even though I can safely say that the source material that provided it was fairly entertaining. I don\\'t know much about dialog translation, but the cross between Hindi and English made me question the writer\\'s ability of communication.The acting is horrible. Arshad Warsi looks uninterested through out the entire movie, Aashish Chowdhry does his best as does the actor who plays the character that I hate but this does not make them entertaining. Both of them have a look of desperation throughout the entire film that says \"Please like me, please like me audience!\". Ritesh Deshmukh (who hasn\\'t been in the best of films) looks sorely out of place and doesn\\'t look like he\\'s enjoying his role at all. The things some people do for money. Sanjay Dutt adds another horrible film to his resume which is already chock full of horrible films (thanks in part to his friendship with Sanjay Gupta), it\\'s sad because I do think there is talent there that hasn\\'t been properly used or been discovered by an appropriate director.The direction is absolutely horrible. If you\\'re going to copy a film, at least do it right.The soundtrack is alright, but once again is forced. The opening credits function as a music video for the film.

Yes, it is one of the worst films I have ever seen, however how bad it is exactly cannot be measured by a mere passing remark.I am a huge fan of Paul Giamatti & Clive Owen, their combined body of work is impressive to say the least, with works such as Sideways, The Illusionist and American Splendour (Giamatti) with Croupier, I'll Sleep When I'm Dead and Children of Men (Owen) to their name, this is a pedigree of some standard and to bring them together on a project has gave this film some much needed gravitas that has allowed it to have a cinema release, because believe me if this film didn't have these actors in it, it would have never seen the light of day.I am not adverse to films of a mindless nature, believe me I have sat through films such as Deep Blue Sea and Transformers and been thoroughly entertained, they are what they are, however when you have a mindless action film that have bad set pieces terrible dialogue, even worse scripting and woeful special effects all you are left with is Shoot 'em Up.From babies being delivered in the middle of gunfights, people having sex in the middle of gunfights, people parachuting in the middle of gunfights, gunfights in the middle of gunfights, this film is loud, clichéd, stupid and just basically a mess.The dialogue sounds like it has been written by a 1st year film student who has been watching Lock, Stock and two Smoking Barrels on a continuous loop. The action sequences are terribly handled, feeling unrealistic, stilted and just plain rubbish. The special effects make this already bad film just feel even worse, I am aware what this film is trying to do with its tongue in cheek take on the action flick, however not to throw any money into the budget of this film (£23,000,000) has meant it doesn't even have its special effects to rely on, they make it look cheap and quite unremarkable.Ultimately what is unfortunate about this film is that it has been able to attract two of Hollywood's brightest talents and shoe-horn them into one of the biggest piles of sh*t I have ever seen.

The director forces his audience to watch a series of vile atrocities committed towards an innocent and undeserving party. The film made me want to reach into the screen and do something about it, and the fact that I couldn't makes this film one of the most gut-wrenching and unbearable movie watching experiences of my long movie watching 'career'. Mainstream Hollywood tends to specialise in searing emotional dramas designed to make its audience shed tears - but the fact that everything here is presented completely raw means that the audience is left to make their own minds up; which has apparently left some viewers unaffected - but it was what ultimately made the film so powerful for me.The film takes place in the fifties and we focus on David Moran; a young boy who meets a young girl named Meg Loughlin when she moves in next door with her sister after the death of their parents. Her presence incites the matriarch of the household; who takes it upon herself to use her sons (along with some other neighbourhood children) to torture and abuse Meg, while the case goes unreported. The first third of the movie is not too far removed from being a drama about a group of children in the summertime; but as the film moves on, things start to get dark pretty quickly and by then the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits role. The violence shown in the movie is not particularly explicit; and that's possibly why the film didn't get a rousing reception from some circles who were hoping for an exploitation flick. What we do see is more than enough, however, and it's the situation that really makes the film what it is. The acting is brilliant also; with the monstrous Blanche Baker heading up a cast of youngsters. Every film is looked at in different ways by different people; but I honestly am surprised that some people who saw this film were not affected by it.
